A plugin for serving 'security.txt' in WordPress 4.9+, based on configuration settings.

== Description ==

The purpose of this project is to create a set-it-and-forget-it plugin that can be installed without much effort to get a WordPress site compliant with the current [`security.txt`](https://securitytxt.org/) spec. It is therefore highly opinionated but built for configuration. It will automatically configure itself but you are encouraged to visit the plugin settings page after activating it.

[`security.txt`](https://github.com/securitytxt) is a [draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-00) "standard" which allows websites to define security policies. This "standard" sets clear guidelines for security researchers on how to report security issues, and allows bug bounty programs to define a scope. Security.txt is the equivalent of `robots.txt`, but for security issues.

There is a help page built into the plugin if you need help configuring it. For developers, there is [documentation for `wordpress-security-txt` online](https://austinheap.github.io/wordpress-security-txt/), the source of which is in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/austinheap/wordpress-security-txt/tree/master/docs) directory. The most logical place to start are the [docs for the `WordPress_Security_Txt` class](https://austinheap.github.io/wordpress-security-txt/packages/WordPress.Security.Txt.html).

If you would like to contribute a new languge or you spotted in error in one of the translation files, please feel free to contribute directly to the [public `wordpress-security-txt` POEditor project](https://poeditor.com/join/project/utTvBn327C). Once accepted additions/modifications are automagically built by POEditor to PO/MO files and published to the [wordpress-security-txt-translation](https://github.com/austinheap/wordpress-security-txt-translations) repository.

The translations repository is included in builds submitted to the WordPress plugin directory. Users with the [GitHub Updater Plugin](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) don't have to wait for builds to the WordPress plugin directory -- they can get updated translations as soon as they're published to the repository by POEditor.
