<p id="wordpress-security-txt-sections[directives]" class="hide-when-disabled">
    Here you can define the values for the various <code>security.txt</code> declaratives. More information about each
    directive can be found within the <a href="?page=wordpress-security-txt-help">specification</a> itself. Please
    note that while the specification allows more than one <code>Contact</code> directive to be present, this plugin
    currently only supports a single record (e-mail, URL, or phone number).
