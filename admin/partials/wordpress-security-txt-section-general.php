<p id="wordpress-security-txt-sections[general]">
    The purpose of this project is to create a set-it-and-forget-it plugin that can be installed without much effort
    to get a WordPress site compliant with the current <code>security.txt</code> spec. It is therefore highly
    opinionated but built for configuration. When enabled, it allows access to all clients and serves up the
    <code>security.txt</code> in the correct location. It will automatically configure itself but you are welcome to
    override any of the values below. For more information, please see the
    <a href="?page=wordpress-security-txt-help">help section</a> for this plugin.
